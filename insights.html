            <div class="longptext">
                <p>
                    The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has redefined conventional forms of social interactions and
                    slowed
                    down the global economy at large.
                    Central and Non-Central Governments worldwide continue to enforce lockdown and quarantine measures,
                    even
                    as some have begun to ease their social distancing policies gradually.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Amid these uncertain times, one of the sectors that have sustained its activities is the creative
                    economy. Artists, entrepreneurs, and the larger creative community have increasingly shifted to
                    virtual
                    platforms for creative expressions such as online concerts and digital exhibitions. This has also
                    spurred the exchange of cultural ideas, as seen in the Global #BlackLivesMatter phenomenon, a raging
                    social media trend that came to symbolize the Global Black Diaspora's soft power.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Going forward in the post-COVID-19 world, even though its avenues and growth opportunities will
                    undergo
                    a transformation, the creative economy will continue to be pivotal in shaping a Nation's soft power
                    as
                    well as contributing to economic development.
                    The creative economy harnesses the potential of culture, indigenous knowledge, and innovation as
                    economic resources. Contributing over 3 percent to the global GDP, it is one of the fastest-growing
                    and
                    the most resilient sectors of the economy.

                    The creative economy incorporates both traditional cultural industries—where commercial value is
                    attributed to products of indigenous culture and thought—as well as contemporary creative forms that
                    are
                    technology-enabled. It broadly includes arts and crafts, design, fashion, gastronomy, performing
                    arts,
                    education, and visual arts. However, there are no single criteria, and Nations may have their own
                    cultural and creative industries that define their domestic creative economy.
                    For example, tourism steers the creative economy in Calabar, Nigeria, and is also the small
                    semi-urban
                    dwellers' economic mainstay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As illustrated in the case of Calabar, cultural industries are important contributors to economic
                    prosperity and sustaining local livelihoods. They are also symbolic of a people's cultural heritage
                    and
                    integral for advancing soft power.
                    Cultural hubs, including museums and tourist destinations, invite artists and travelers, thereby
                    enhancing a Nation's international attractiveness. On the other hand, by exporting creative goods
                    and
                    services, Nations can increase their brand value and influence consumer choices in the international
                    market.
                    A culturally vibrant country can also enable its government to facilitate cross-cultural exchange
                    and
                    knowledge sharing with their global contemporaries.

                <h2>The Global Creative Economy</h2>
                <p>
                    With the realization that the creative economy has both cultural and commercial value, Central and
                    Non-Central Governments across the world have invested in augmenting their soft power through local
                    cultural and creative industries.
                    For instance, the creative economy of France, employing over 600,000 individuals and accounting for
                    over
                    2 percent of the GDP, is one of the key elements of its soft power. Cultural manifestations,
                    including
                    music, cinema, fine arts, literature, and architectural heritage, have shaped a unique French
                    identity,
                    rooted in ideals of art de vivre or the art of living. The inherent penchant for luxury is also
                    exhibited in French gastronomy, ranging from chocolates to fine dining and fashion pioneered by
                    brands
                    including Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Dior. With flourishing creative industries, France is a leader
                    in
                    cultural exports in Europe. Furthermore, organizations like Alliance Francaise in promoting the
                    French
                    language and culture through its global centers have led to France being one of the world's most
                    visited
                    countries.

                    Other Examples
                    The contribution of creative industries to the national economy is not unique to France. In Wales,
                    creative industries remain among the fastest-growing sectors of the economy. This has provided an
                    impetus for the government to implement policies such as "Creative Wales," which aims to consolidate
                    the
                    link between social welfare, innovation, and economic growth in the region. Similarly, the
                    government of
                    Japan had launched the "Cool Japan Initiative" to expand the domestic market for creative industries
                    and
                    also harness their soft power potential as cultural exports. The cutting-edge technological
                    innovations
                    further add to the uniqueness of Japanese creative industries—as exemplified through the global
                    demand
                    for products like Sony Entertainment, Anime, and Nintendo.
