                <p>The creative economy of indigenous peoples, when exported
                    in the form of cultural products and services, also contributes
                    to its soft power. It not only creates market opportunities but
                    also increases attractiveness and global reputation.
                </p>
                <p>One of Africa's major culture-driven soft powers is the Great Kingdom of Benin, Edo State, Nigeria,
                    which is endowed with a rich and diverse creative economy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Among its largest cultural exports are the Benin bronze art pieces and other artifacts that are
                    housed in various museums around the world.

                    In the performing Arts, icons such Sir Victor Uwaifo, Sonny Okosun,
                    and Waziri Oshomah have served as cultural ambassadors of Edo peoples.
                    In Continental Europe - France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands, the
                    demand for Edo films and music has carved a niche, being one of the most
                    sought-after sources of recreation among the Edo diaspora and contributes
                    to the growth of the domestic creative economy as well.

                <p>
                    Edo's soft power is also bolstered by its approach to traditional medicine and espoused by the Monks
                    in The Ewu Monastery and its cuisine, which are gradually enhancing their global appeal. However,
                    the full potential of Edo's indigenous knowledge remains to be harnessed as a sector within the
                    creative economy. Edo could leverage this opportunity by blending innovation with traditional
                    practices and tap into the rising global market for wellness that is worth $4.5 trillion.

                    <br>
                    Cultural and creative industries in Edo are as vast and variegated as the region itself. It is
                    underpinned by a millennia-old living civilization and rich cultural heritage—both tangible and
                    intangible, and multiple art forms.

                    The Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) a pet project of HE Governor Godwin Obaseki’s
                    Administration, the Legacy Trust and the British Museum is underway in Benin City, Edo State, and
                    upon completion would showcase the history and archaeology of the Benin Kingdom. Designed by the
                    globally renowned architect, David Adjaye, the museum would house historic art and artefacts and
                    incorporate galleries dedicated to contemporary art. Upon completion, this would undoubtedly enhance
                    Edo’s soft power.

                    Furthermore, being one of the fastest-growing digital economies and a rising IT hub in Southern
                    Nigeria paves the way for Edo to harness its culture as an asset and expand its global footprint. As
                    engagements between international communities increase, a result of sophisticated technological
                    advancements, the exchange of ideas and their translation into the cultural and creative economy
                    could play a crucial role in strengthening Edo's soft power.
